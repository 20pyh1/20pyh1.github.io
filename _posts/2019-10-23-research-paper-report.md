**Summary**

The paper I read, "Internet Recommendation Systems" by Ansari, Essegaier, and Kohli, examines the merits of two different types of recommendation systems most commonly used by online firms at the time of publication (August 2000). The first is comprised of collborative filtering, which "mimics word-of-mouth recommendations" and predict a person's preferences as a function of other people's preferences. The second is called content filtering and bases recommendations on user preferences for product attributes. There are at least five main information sourcces for making recommendations: expressed preferences among alternative products, preferences for product attributes, other people's preferences and choices, expert judgements, and predictive individual characteristics.
